# [Homework #22] - CSR, SSR, SSG, Next.js

This homework was done using Nextjs with React.

## Scripts

### Running on local

To run it on localhost, first run `yarn` to install dependencies and then you can either run `yarn dev` for the development branch or you can build the app with `yarn build` and preview your production build with `yarn preview`.

## Domain

This is the [Vercel]() deployment. I manually copied the files on a new [repo](https://github.com/JuanMM94/react-laba-international-1-jmon-22-csr-ssr-ssg-nextjs). I used my personal account since Vercel doesn't allow multiple accounts on a single phone number.
